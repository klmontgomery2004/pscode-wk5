// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

1. Start
2. Declare integer variables num1, num2, sum
3. Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in num1
4. Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in num2
5. Calculate sum = num1 + num2
6. Print "The sum is" followed by sum
7. End

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Start
2. Declare integer variable num
3. Prompt the user to enter a number and store it in num
4. If num modulo 2 equals 0
     a. Print "The number is even"
   Else
     a. Print "The number is odd"
5. End

// Exercise 3: Perform the Given Tasks with Five Numbers

1. Start
2. Declare integer array numbers[5]
3. Declare integer variables i, sum, min, max
4. Initialize sum to 0
5. For i from 0 to 4
     a. Prompt the user to enter a number and store it in numbers[i]
     b. Add numbers[i] to sum
     c. If i is 0
          i. Set min to numbers[i]
          ii. Set max to numbers[i]
        Else
          i. If numbers[i] < min, set min to numbers[i]
          ii. If numbers[i] > max, set max to numbers[i]
6. Calculate average as sum / 5
7. Print "The average is" followed by average
8. Print "The smallest number is" followed by min
9. Print "The largest number is" followed by max
